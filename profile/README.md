# Dotpen Labs

we make small tools that feel like paper and think like a browser.  
nothing heavy — just calm interfaces for everyday thoughts and productivity.

## what we believe

- software should feel soft, and smooth.
- tools should disappear when you're thinking
- the best apps are the ones you forget you're using
- fast is a feature. minimal is a mindset.

## who we are

just one (hope soon more) people who like building things for the web,  
keeping them fast, clean, and a little bit playful.

thanks for stopping by ♡
